		<h3>Mission</h3>
		<p>
			As leaders of the Northeastern University chapter of the Association
			of Computing Machinery, our goal is to expose students to a diverse
			range of computer science topics, and build a community within the university.
			We believe that there's a lot more to computer science than what you see in the
			classroom, and we bring people together by hosting events that further their
			knowledge of the field.
		</p>

		<h3>Events</h3>
		<p>
			We have meetings every <strong>Wednesday at 19:00</strong>
			during the academic year. We usually meet in <strong>366 West Village H</strong>,
			which is located at 440 Huntington Avenue. Our past events include tech talks, workshops, coding competitions, and
			many others. Event dates and locations may change from week to week.
		</p>

		<p>
			To find out more about our upcoming events, please check our
			<a href="https://www.facebook.com/nuacm">facebook page</a>. We use facebook for most of
			our event scheduling purposes, so it is updated very regularly. You can also sign up for
			our <a href="http://eepurl.com/EkKhD">mailing list</a> to receive event updates by email.
		</p>

		<h3>Contact</h3>
		<p>
			For general questions, comments, or event suggestions, the best way to
			reach us is by email at <a href="mailto:acm@ccs.neu.edu">acm@ccs.neu.edu</a>. We are always
			looking for speakers and event partners, so please contact us if you'd like
			to work together!
